# CUDA Device Configuration & Multi-GPU Support - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Problem Solved
The original issue was that `cuda_visible_devices: "0,1,4,7"` was configured but **not being used** by the training scripts. The training was defaulting to only use `cuda:0` instead of utilizing the specified 4 GPUs.

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

### 1. Device Management Utility (`src/utils/device_manager.py`)
- **DeviceManager class** with comprehensive CUDA device handling
- **Environment variable management** - properly sets `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`
- **Device validation** - checks availability and current usage
- **Memory monitoring** - tracks GPU memory usage across devices
- **Multi-GPU configuration** - optimizes batch sizes and setup for distributed training

### 2. Updated Training Scripts
- **`train.py`** - Now uses DeviceManager and applies device config
- **`finetune_clinical_bert.py`** - Basic device environment setting
- **Device setup occurs before model loading** to ensure proper GPU allocation

### 3. Enhanced Trainer (`src/training/trainer.py`)
- **WeightedTrainer** now supports multi-GPU with DataParallel
- **Automatic batch size optimization** for multiple GPUs
- **Dynamic training arguments** setup based on available devices
- **GPU memory monitoring** during training

### 4. Updated ModelManager (`src/models/model_manager.py`)
- **Device-aware model loading** with explicit device placement
- **Updated method signatures** to accept device parameters
- **Fallback model loading** respects device configuration

### 5. Enhanced Evaluation Scripts
- **`evaluate.py`** updated to use device management
- **`src/evaluation/evaluator.py`** now device-aware
- **Consistent device handling** across training and evaluation

### 6. Configuration Updates
- **`configs/training/default.yaml`** - Added multi-GPU settings
- **`gradient_accumulation_steps`** and **`use_multi_gpu`** options
- **Backward compatible** with existing configurations

## üß™ Validation & Testing

### Test Results (from `test_device_config.py`)
- ‚úÖ **Device Detection**: Correctly identifies 8 NVIDIA RTX A5000 GPUs
- ‚úÖ **Busy Device Detection**: Identifies devices 2,3,5,6 as currently in use
- ‚úÖ **CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES**: Successfully sets to "0,1,4,7"
- ‚úÖ **Batch Size Optimization**: Adjusts from 16 to 2 per device (16 total effective)
- ‚úÖ **Configuration Integration**: Correctly reads and applies config settings

## üìä Expected Performance Improvements

### Before Implementation
- **Used only 1 GPU** (cuda:0) regardless of configuration
- **Effective batch size**: 16 (single device)
- **Training speed**: Baseline

### After Implementation
- **Uses 4 specified GPUs** (0,1,4,7) as configured
- **Effective batch size**: 16 total (4 per device √ó 4 GPUs)
- **Training speed**: ~4x faster (ideal case)
- **Memory distribution**: Load spread across 4 GPUs instead of 1

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### For Training
```bash
# The configuration automatically applies device settings
python train.py

# Or use the original script with basic device support
python finetune_clinical_bert.py
```

### For Evaluation
```bash
# Device configuration is also applied to evaluation
python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/model --data_path /path/to/data
```

### Configuration
The device settings in `configs/config.yaml` are now fully functional:
```yaml
# GPU configuration
tensor_parallelism: 4
cuda_visible_devices: "0,1,4,7"

# Training configuration
training:
  gradient_accumulation_steps: 1
  use_multi_gpu: true
```

## üîß Key Implementation Details

### Device Setup Flow
1. **Configuration loading** ‚Üí reads `cuda_visible_devices`
2. **Environment variable setting** ‚Üí sets `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`
3. **Device validation** ‚Üí checks device availability and usage
4. **Model loading** ‚Üí loads model with proper device placement

- **Memory monitoring** to prevent OOM errors
- **Graceful degradation** to single GPU if multi-GPU fails

## üìà Monitoring & Logging
The implementation provides comprehensive logging:
- Device configuration at startup
- GPU memory usage during training
- Multi-GPU status and effective batch sizes
- Device-specific performance metrics

This implementation ensures that your specified CUDA devices (0,1,4,7) are properly utilized for both training and evaluation, with significant performance improvements from multi-GPU parallelization.
